# tinder-auto-swiper
this code is developed on pycharm using selenium and random module.
to run this , all you need to do is take the code , replace the 'your_email' and 'your_password' with your own credentials , and install selenium in pycharm and the script will run. 
tinder currently allows only 50 likes per 12 hours , and if you don't swipe left on some people it recognises that you are a bot. 
you can also host this code on the cloud so that it runs automatically at a specific time.
